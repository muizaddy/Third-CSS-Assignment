    I will dearly miss Steve Jobs he inspired me to keep getting the iphones i have loved them ever since the first one. Steve Jobs was a great man and a awesome CEO for APPLE. He has inspired me to one day and go for and work with the apple when i get old but my dream is to own Apple and follow by Steve Jobs he's a great man and I will never forget him.

                <p class="tribute">What impact has Steve Jobs had on my life? Every short story I've written as an adult (and ceeertainly every one that has been published), almost every email I've ever written, have been written on machines created by Apple. I interacted online using an Apple machine long befre I ever encounterd a PC. Steve Jobs helped to realize the Star Trek future I dreamed of as a kid. And through his vsion, I have been able to realize my own. You'll be missed, Mr. Jobs. Thanks for all your amazing work.</p>
